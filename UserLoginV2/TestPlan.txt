Test Plan
User Login Project
Jeffrey Cutcliffe

After the skeleton program is written, test whether each method call happens at the right time with print messages.

Test the readUser method to ensure its reading from the user and printing to the screen.

After writting a check method, test cases that would pass and fail the test. Repeat for each check method.

Test the loop in main that allows for multiple user logins, make sure its working properly.

Test the checkvalidity method with many tests that fail only certain apsects of the specifications. Then test
multiple spec failures, make sure the output is correct.

After changing the output to go to a file, test all cases of pass and fail, make sure the output is going to the right place 
and writing to the file in the correct format.
